                            <p class="content">The Professor, real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to being a sick child.
                                He leads the gang, and is the one who carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain.
                                He is sophisticated but nerdy.
                                The idea of the first heist is to avenge his father, whose idea it originally was.
                                His grandfather had fought against the fascists in Italy.
                                He was the mastermind behind the plans of the two heists.
                                He controlled the heist through a hiding outside the Royal Mint.
                                [2] The Professor falls in love with Raquel Murillo, a police investigator leading the case against the heist.
                                He sleeps with her and when her mother finds out about his involvement with the heist, he attempts to poison her but pulls out at the last second, opting to take advantage of her poor memory and deleting the voicemail.
                                The Professor spent years of his life meticulously planning the heist, and covered aspects that most people wouldn’t think of.
                                His tactic was to lead the police to several dead ends to buy more time for the money to be printed and the team to escape.

                            <p class="content"> Berlin was born on April 7, 1975[1].

                                When he was young, his mother had a relation with another man which resulted in the birth of his half brother, the Professor.
                                
                                Before joining the Robbers of The Royal Mint of Spain, Berlin was a jewel thief, with twenty-seven robberies to his name of jewelry stores, auction houses, and armored vehicles. His biggest theft, before the Royal Mint of Spain, was 434 diamonds in Champs-Élysées, Paris. He was later diagnosed with Helmer's Myopathy.
                                
                                Somewhere in his life, he was recruited by his half brother to be the leader of the “greatest robbery ever”. He was trained in various things along with his fellow robbers, and he learned all the details of the heist.
                                
                                Berlin has been married 5 times. One of his ex-wives is Tatiana. They divorced after Berlin discovered that Tatiana had cheated on him with his son Rafael.</p>

                            <p class="content"> THe is a complex, skilled engineer with egoistical tendencies. 
                                He needs to be in charge and doesn't tolerate being out of control very well. 
                                Being an impulsive character, he sometimes makes decisions without thinking them through, leading to unwanted complications.
                                 Nevertheless, he is able to admit his wrongdoings and willing to fix the problems they caused if possible.
                                  The first impression people get of him is that of a cold, mean and uncaring personality. It takes some time to realize that this is just the facade he has built for himself in order not to get hurt.
                                   Furthermore, he is passionate about the things he wants. He displays this for the heist, as it was made by Berlin, 
                                the man who meant the most to him and loved dearly.</p>
